            <p>
              The earliest credible evidence of coffee-drinking or knowledge of
              the coffee tree appears in the middle of the 15th century in the
              accounts of Ahmed al-Ghaffar in Yemen. It was in Arabia that
              coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed in a similar way to how
              it is prepared now.overed

              <summary>Coffee arrives to Europe</summary>
              <p>
                European travelers to the Near East brought back stories of an
                unusual dark black beverage. By the 17th century, coffee had
                made its way to Europe and was becoming popular across the
                continent. Some people reacted to this new beverage with
                suspicion or fear, calling it the “bitter invention of Satan.”
                The local clergy condemned coffee when it came to Venice in
                1615. The controversy was so great that Pope Clement VIII was
                asked to intervene. He decided to taste the beverage for himself
                before making a decision, and found the drink so satisfying that
                he gave it papal approval. Despite such controversy, coffee
                houses were quickly becoming centers of social activity and
                communication in the major cities of England, Austria, France,
                Germany and Holland. In England “penny universities” sprang up,
                so called because for the price of a penny one could purchase a
                cup of coffee and engage in stimulating conversation.
